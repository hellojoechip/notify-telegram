# Beginner's Guide 

## Setting up telegram
This is for creating a bot and channel.
1. Search for 'BotFather' on [telegram](https://telegram.org/).
2. Create and name your bot.
3. Create a new telegram channel.
4. Add the bot created to your new channel.

## Setting up ifttt
1. Create an account and login to [ifttt](https://ifttt.com).

## The webhooks setup
This is for creating the automated message and sending it a publicly accessible URL when a commit is made.
1. Login to [webhooks settings](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks/settings).
2. Copy and paste URL into browser.
3. Fill in the blanks. (event: devops3 -- I used my telegram channel name)
4. Copy the curl, replace the last line of test1.yml file with this. 

## The ifttt setup <br/>
This requires 2 applets to be created. <br/>
Each applet has a trigger (if) and response (then).
